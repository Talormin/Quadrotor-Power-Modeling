Flight endurance remains a critical bottleneck limiting the large-scale deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Inaccurate power estimation can result in suboptimal resource allocation and potentially compromise operational safety. Therefore, high-precision real-time power modeling is essential for energy-aware mission planning. To address this challenge, a Physics-Informed Stochastic Long Short-Term Memory (PI-S-LSTM) framework is proposed. This framework tightly integrates physical priors with temporal learning. Specifically, a structured fusion mechanism is developed in which the total power consumption is decomposed into physical components, including horizontal, vertical, hovering, and nonlinear transient terms. These components are explicitly mapped to dedicated neurons in the final hidden layer, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is incorporated to compensate for the limitations of steady-state physical models. It enables accurate characterization of nonlinear power consumption during aggressive maneuvers. Meanwhile, a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network is designed to capture complex temporal dependencies from historical flight states and control sequences. Extensive experiments conducted on both simulation and real-flight datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms seven mainstream baselines. Specifically, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is decreased by 35.7%-81.9%, while the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) drops by 31.3%-83.1%, and the coefficient of determination (R²) improves by 1.6%-32.0%. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively combines physics-driven interpretability with data-driven precision. It provides a robust solution for advanced energy management strategies.
